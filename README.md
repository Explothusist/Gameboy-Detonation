# Gameboy-Detonation
Javascript Gameboy Emulator embeded into HTML Canvas

# Running the Emulator
In the Emulator folder, there are three html files, all of which access the emulator. The gui_emulator is recommended if you want to use the emulator for fun. The basic_emulator has more debug capabilities, but the user must do and understand significantly more to use it.
